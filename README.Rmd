# GTFS_frequencies
## This script presents a function to convert a set of original GTFS files into generic ones which simulates a ´full frequency´scenario.

The script is intent to replace original frequency of public transport service by a generic one, which assumes ´full frequency´ (no waiting times in cases at public transort stops), keeping the original travel times between stops. It is prepared in order to investige impact of public transport´s routing scheme on accessibility level (regardless applied resources, i.e. real frequency). 

The script is prepared within ´MSCA´ CAlCULUS project.

### Load required files from the directory which contains oryginal GTFS files: 

  a) files to be simplified:
  - trips.txt
  - stop_times.txt
  b) files to be just copied to the final directory:
  - agency.txt
  - routes.txt
  - stops.txt
  c) generic files to be created for ´full frequency scenario´:
  - calendar.txt
  - frequencies.txt
  Source https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/

### workflow

1) load libraries

2) simplify trips and stop_times: only one trip per route is selected, The rest are removed.

3) recalculate arrival and departure times to start each trip at 00:00:00

4) create calendar and frequencies files

5) create a destination sub-directory for the output

6) clean the RStudio environment

### required libraries:

```{}
library(data.table)
library(chron)
library(lubridate)
```

### input to be specified:

- `dir_GTFS`: directory where original GTFS files are stored. 
- `dir_final`: directory where modified GTFS files will be saved.
- `headway`: generic frequency of service; default: `60` seconds
- `GenericDate`: generic date of the service (only one day); default: `"20180515"`.
- `Threshold`: the time converage of a generic GTFS full frequency scenario. Depends on the size of the area or applied threshold for OD matrix (maximum considered travel time); default: `120`.

### output
- set of generic GTFS files.

### function syntax:

```{}
FullFrequency_GTFS(dir_GTFS, dir_final, headway = 60, GenericDate =  "20180515", Threshold = 120)
```

### variables used for testing
```{}
DirLoc <- "../DATA/Data_GTFS/Data_GTFS_oryg/google_transit_M10"
DirFinal <- "../DATA/Data_GTFS/Data_GTFS_FullFreq/google_transit_M10"
```
